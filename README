Audio::SID version 3.02
=======================

This module is designed to handle SID files (usually bearing a .sid
extension), which are music player and data routines converted from the
Commodore-64 computer with an additional informational header prepended. For
further details about the exact file format, see description of all SID
fields in the included SID_file_format.txt file. For information about SID
tunes in general, see the excellent SIDPLAY homepage at:

For SID v2NG documentation:

You can find literally thousands of SID tunes in the High Voltage SID
Collection at:

This module can handle both version 1 and version 2/2NG SID files. (Version 2
files are simply v2NG files where v2NG specific fields are set 0.) The module
was designed primarily to make it easier to look at and change the SID header
fields, so many of the methods are geared towards that.
